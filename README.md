# Surfs_Up Analysis
### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to gather climate data for the months of June and December of the island Oahu to determine whether the ice cream and surf shop business would sustainable year-round. 
The climate data was accessed by creating a connection to a Sqlite database 'hawaii.sqlite' and analyzed with Jupyter Notebook.

### Results
#### June Summary Statistics
- The mean temperature in June is ~75 degrees (74.9 degrees) with a standard deviation of 3.26 degrees. 
- The maximum recorded temperature in June was 85 degrees and the minimum was 64 degrees. 

#### December Summary Statistics
- The mean temperature in December is 71.0 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.74 degrees. 
- The maximum recorded temperature in December was 83 degrees and the minimum was 56 degrees.

### Summary
The difference in mean temperature between June and December in Oahu is 4 degrees, which is not a significant change. However, the variability in temprature is greater in December than in June, which could mean lower ice-crea,/surf sales. 
Another factor related to weather that could affect profits could be rainfall. Two additional queries were performed to find mean rainfall in June and December (can be found in Surfs_Up_Challenge.ipynb under 'Challenge' header). It was found that the mean preciptation for June was 0.13 inches and for December was 0.21 inches, a difference of a tenth of an inch, which doesn't appear like it would have a huge effect on the sustainability of the business.
